# Architecture

## Purpose

`seishin2d` is a native 2D game engine prototype with a Rust core and a stable interoperability boundary for future gameplay languages and tooling.

The project is authorial, modular, and pragmatic. The MVP should prove a small 2D vertical slice before introducing broad engine abstractions.

## MVP Contract

The MVP targets Windows and Linux desktop first.

### In Scope

- desktop window and lifecycle;
- update/render loop;
- normalized keyboard input;
- simple entity/transform model;
- 2D sprite rendering;
- simple 2D camera;
- asset loading from disk;
- simple audio for MVP completion unless explicitly deferred;
- one playable example: `examples/basic_2d`;
- stable public Rust API surface;
- future-safe C ABI / FFI preparation.

### First Playable Demo Definition

`examples/basic_2d` is the first playable demo. It should open a desktop window, clear the background, load a sprite through the asset subsystem, render it, move it with keyboard input, use or validate a simple camera, log useful lifecycle information, and shut down cleanly.

### Out of Scope

- Android runtime implementation;
- Go binding implementation;
- editor tooling;
- scripting;
- hot reload;
- multiplayer;
- complex UI;
- advanced physics;
- advanced rendering features;
- exact Bevy parity.

Android and Go bindings remain future design constraints, not MVP implementation requirements.

## Reference Inputs

`_reversa_sdd/` contains generated specifications derived from Bevy analysis. These documents are useful for architecture patterns, risks, and terminology, including plugin composition, schedules, renderer separation, asset safety, and platform input concerns.

They are not a parity mandate. `seishin2d` should not import Bevy-scale complexity into the MVP unless a specific MVP requirement justifies it.

## Public Boundary Model

```txt
Game Code
  -> Optional Language Binding
  -> C ABI / FFI
  -> Public Engine API
  -> Rust Engine Internals
```

Only the Rust engine internals own runtime state, rendering, assets, audio, physics, input, and lifecycle implementation details.

Bindings and examples use stable public API types, opaque handles, IDs, and C-compatible values. They must not depend on internal Rust structs.

## Crate Responsibilities

### `seishin2d`

Owns the ergonomic facade for applications and examples:

- reexports subsystem crates under domain modules;
- exposes `seishin2d::prelude::*` for common gameplay/demo types;
- keeps backend internals hidden behind subsystem public APIs.

This crate is the preferred dependency for game code. Subsystem crates remain available for advanced users and internal composition.

### `seishin2d_core`

Owns stable engine-domain primitives and safe public API concepts:

- `EngineConfig`;
- `Engine`;
- lifecycle/update context;
- future entity IDs and transforms;
- errors and result types.

`seishin2d_core` must stay backend-agnostic. It must not depend on `winit`, `wgpu`, `kira`, `image`, or platform-specific crates.

### `seishin2d_runtime`

Owns application lifecycle orchestration:

- fixed-step/headless loops for tests and examples;
- future `winit` desktop event loop integration;
- coordination between update, input, render, assets, and audio.

Runtime composes subsystems. It should not absorb renderer, asset loader, or audio backend internals.

### `seishin2d_render`

Owns render-facing engine concepts and the future `wgpu` implementation:

- clear colors;
- 2D camera state;
- future sprites, textures, pipelines, and batching.

`wgpu` types must remain private implementation details. Public API should expose engine concepts such as `Camera2D`, `Sprite`, texture handles, and render configuration.

### `seishin2d_input`

Owns normalized input state independent from window backends:

- engine key codes;
- pressed/released state;
- future `just_pressed` / `just_released` transitions;
- future mouse, touch, and gamepad abstractions.

`winit` event types must not leak into public input APIs.

### `seishin2d_assets`

Owns stable asset identifiers and loading policy:

- asset paths;
- typed handles;
- future loaders, caches, and manifests.

The MVP asset loader should enforce an approved asset root, reject path traversal, and return controlled errors for missing or invalid files.

### `seishin2d_audio`

Owns the audio facade:

- load/play commands;
- future `kira` integration;
- sound/music handles without leaking backend details.

No audio backend type should appear in public engine API or FFI.

### `seishin2d_physics`

Reserved for simple 2D collision and future physics integration.

Physics is outside the first playable demo unless the demo explicitly needs basic collision.

### `seishin2d_ffi`

Owns the C ABI boundary:

- opaque `SeishinEngine` handle;
- `#[repr(C)]` config/status values;
- null-safe create/destroy/tick/frame functions;
- panic containment.

This crate is the only boundary future Go bindings should call through cgo or generated bindings.

## Dependency Direction Rules

Preferred direction:

```txt
examples/*
  -> public engine crates

seishin2d_ffi
  -> safe public Rust API

seishin2d_runtime
  -> seishin2d_core
  -> subsystem public APIs

subsystem crates
  -> seishin2d_core only when shared engine-domain types are needed

seishin2d_core
  -> no backend crates
```

Rules:

- Avoid dependency cycles.
- Subsystem crates should not depend on `seishin2d_runtime`.
- `seishin2d_ffi` must not depend directly on backend crates.
- Examples should prefer public API and must not reach into private implementation modules.
- If a facade crate is added later, it should be deliberate and documented.

## Backend Privacy Rules

- `winit` belongs behind runtime/platform integration.
- `wgpu` belongs behind render implementation.
- `image` belongs behind assets implementation.
- `kira` belongs behind audio implementation.
- `bevy_ecs`, if adopted later, must stay internal and must not cross FFI.

## ECS Position

The immediate MVP should defer `bevy_ecs` unless implementation proves a strong need.

The first vertical slice should use simple engine-owned entities, transforms, and commands. This keeps the public API small and prevents early coupling to ECS internals. A post-MVP ADR can revisit `bevy_ecs` if gameplay complexity, reusable systems, query ergonomics, or editor/tooling requirements justify it.

## FFI Boundary Rules

Allowed across FFI:

- opaque handles;
- integer IDs;
- `#[repr(C)]` structs with primitive fields;
- explicit status/error codes;
- caller-owned output pointers with null checks;
- create/destroy ownership pairs.

Forbidden across FFI:

- Rust references;
- lifetimes;
- traits;
- generics;
- `Vec<T>`;
- `HashMap`;
- Rust `String`;
- closures;
- ECS internals;
- backend types such as `winit`, `wgpu`, `image`, or `kira`.

The FFI grows only after the equivalent safe Rust API behavior is implemented, tested, and considered stable enough to wrap.

## MVP Validation

Automated baseline:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo build --workspace
```

Recommended before closing substantial work:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -p xtask -- check
```

Manual final demo checklist:

- `examples/basic_2d` opens a native window;
- clear background is visible;
- sprite is visible;
- keyboard input moves the sprite;
- release stops movement as expected;
- missing asset behavior is controlled;
- audio plays or is explicitly skipped/deferred with rationale;
- window close and/or `Escape` exits cleanly.

## Initial Roadmap

1. Keep the workspace split aligned with engine subsystems.
2. Document the MVP contract and ADRs.
3. Strengthen pure logic tests for core/runtime/input/assets/FFI.
4. Add a simple internal entity/transform model.
5. Add a desktop runtime using `winit` that opens a window and drives update/render.
6. Add a `wgpu` renderer that clears the window surface.
7. Connect normalized keyboard input from `winit` into `seishin2d_input`.
8. Render a movable sprite loaded from disk.
9. Add a simple 2D camera and audio facade/playback.
10. Extend the C ABI only after the safe Rust API stabilizes.

## Open Contract Questions

- Should simple audio remain a hard MVP completion requirement, or be explicitly deferred after the first playable visual/input demo?
- Which concrete image/audio assets should be committed under `examples/basic_2d/assets/`?
- What level of Linux manual validation evidence is required before MVP closure?
