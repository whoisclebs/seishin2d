`seishin` is a native 2D game engine prototype written in Rust. The project starts with a small desktop MVP and is designed around a stable public API boundary so future language bindings can call into the engine through C ABI / FFI instead of touching Rust internals.

The current MVP opens a desktop window or browser canvas, renders a sprite, loads assets, handles keyboard input, and exposes a small future-safe FFI lifecycle boundary.

## About

`seishin` is not trying to compete with Godot, Unity, or Bevy. It is a focused engine-learning project with a pragmatic architecture:

```txt
Rust Engine Core
  -> Stable public Rust API
  -> C ABI / FFI
  -> Future bindings
```

Design goals:

- keep gameplay code independent from renderer internals;
- keep backend crates such as `wgpu`, `winit`, `kira`, and `image` behind engine APIs;
- expose simple handles, IDs, and C-compatible values across FFI;
- avoid Bevy-scale architecture until the MVP proves a real need;
- keep the developer experience pleasant through the `seishin` facade crate and `seishin::prelude::*`.

Initial targets:

- Windows desktop
- Linux desktop
- WebAssembly/browser MVP

Future targets:

- Android
- Go bindings through C ABI / FFI
- additional tooling after the engine core stabilizes

## Current Status

The repository currently contains the MVP vertical slice:

- desktop window through `winit`;
- update/render loop;
- keyboard input;
- `wgpu`-backed clear pass and sprite rendering;
- simple camera support;
- asset loading from disk;
- simple audio playback with graceful degradation;
- browser/WebAssembly build support with no-op audio fallback;
- playable `examples/basic_2d` example;
- C ABI lifecycle smoke boundary in `seishin_ffi`.

Manual visual/audio validation is still required on a desktop session after automated checks pass.

## Built With

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html)
- [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit) for desktop window and events
- [`wgpu`](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) for GPU rendering
- [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image) for image loading
- [`kira`](https://crates.io/crates/kira) for audio playback
- [`raw-window-handle`](https://crates.io/crates/raw-window-handle) for window/render integration
- [`bytemuck`](https://crates.io/crates/bytemuck) for safe GPU buffer casts

Planned or future-facing:

- `bevy_ecs` may be evaluated later, but it is intentionally deferred for the first MVP slice.
- `rapier2d` may be evaluated later for physics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Rust with `rustup`:

```sh
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup default stable
```

This workspace currently uses:

- Rust edition: `2021`
- MSRV declared in Cargo: `1.75`

On Linux, `winit`, `wgpu`, and `kira` may require system packages for windowing, graphics, and audio depending on your distribution. Typical dependencies include X11/Wayland, Vulkan or GPU driver support, ALSA/PulseAudio/PipeWire development packages.

### Clone

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd seishin
```

### Build

```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

### Run The Demo

```sh
cargo run -p seishin_basic_2d
```

### Build The Web Demo

Install the wasm target and `wasm-bindgen` CLI, then export the example:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
cargo run -p xtask -- web-build --example basic_2d
```

The export is written to `target/web/basic_2d`. Serve it locally with:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- web-serve --example basic_2d
```

The web MVP keeps the same game entry point (`seishin::run::<Game>()`) but runs with browser-specific runtime internals. Audio is currently a no-op fallback on wasm; assets and resources are fetched from the static export using the existing `asset://` and `res://` schemes.

Controls:

- Arrow keys or WASD: move sprite through the configured `move` input action
- Space or Enter: open/close the MVP dialogue flow in logs
- Escape: close the demo

## Usage

Game/example code should normally depend on the facade crate and import the prelude:

```rust
use seishin::prelude::*;

mod components;

use components::PlayerController;

struct Game;

impl Game2D for Game {
    fn new(ctx: &mut StartupContext) -> GameResult<Self> {
        ctx.components()
            .register::<PlayerController>("PlayerController")?;

        Ok(Self)
    }
}

fn main() -> GameResult<()> {
    seishin::run::<Game>()
}
```

Projects are configured by `Seishin.toml`. Virtual path schemes are explicit:

- `asset://` resolves under `[assets].root` for images, audio, video, fonts, and other media.
- `res://` resolves under `[resources].root` for scenes, prefabs, configuration, scripts, markup, and data files.
- `user://` is reserved for writable user data such as saves/settings.

For larger games, prefer scene/prefab/component composition over storing every entity handle in `main.rs`:

```txt
resources/scenes/   map and screen placement
resources/prefabs/  reusable entity composition
resources/data/     characters, items, quests, dialogue, and other game data
src/components/     Rust behavior registered by type name
```

`main.rs` can register custom behavior and load the scene:

```rust
ctx.components()
    .register::<PlayerController>("PlayerController")?;
```

`seishin::run::<Game>()` discovers `Seishin.toml`, lets `Game2D::new` register components, then automatically loads `[game].main_scene`.

Components can load their own game data/configuration through the resource API:

```rust
let config = ctx
    .resources()
    .toml("res://data/components/player_controller.toml")?;
let speed = config.f32("speed").unwrap_or(180.0);
```

The current dialogue MVP opens/closes via the configured `interact` action and presents text through `tracing` logs. On-screen text/UI is a future rendering feature.

See the complete example in [`examples/basic_2d`](examples/basic_2d).

```

Each crate keeps `src/lib.rs` as a small facade and places implementation in domain modules such as `engine`, `desktop`, `renderer`, `loader`, `state`, or `ffi`.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Architecture

The engine is split into focused crates. The facade crate `seishin` is the preferred entry point for game code. Lower-level subsystem crates remain available for internal composition and advanced users.

Important rules:

- Gameplay code should not depend on `wgpu`, `winit`, `kira`, or `image` directly.
- FFI must not expose Rust references, generics, traits, lifetimes, `Vec<T>`, `HashMap`, `String`, backend types, or ECS internals.
- Android and Go are future-facing design constraints, not MVP implementation requirements.

More detail:

- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr)
- [`bindings/go/README.md`](bindings/go/README.md)

## Development

Recommended workflow before submitting changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo build --workspace
```

Useful commands:

```sh
cargo run -p seishin_basic_2d
cargo run -p xtask -- check
cargo run -p xtask -- web-build --example basic_2d
cargo run -p xtask -- web-serve --example basic_2d
cargo test -p seishin_core
cargo test -p seishin_render
```

Rust repository practices used here:

- workspace-level dependency declarations;
- `Cargo.lock` tracked for reproducible workspace/example builds;
- MSRV declared with `rust-version`;
- strict Clippy gate with `-D warnings`;
- `xtask` reserved for internal automation;
- crate-level tests for pure logic;
- manual checklist for render/audio behavior that cannot be fully unit-tested.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Testing

Automated baseline:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo build --workspace
```

Full local gate:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo build --workspace
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p seishin_basic_2d
```

Manual demo checklist:

- Run `cargo run -p seishin_basic_2d`.
- Confirm a desktop window opens.
- Confirm the sprite appears over a clear background.
- Confirm arrow keys and WASD move the sprite through the configured `move` input action.
- Press Escape or close the window and confirm clean shutdown.

## Roadmap

The roadmap lives in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) to keep this README focused on onboarding.

Current priorities:

- harden the MVP runtime/render loop;
- improve the high-level game API;
- expand tests around assets, rendering, and FFI safety;
- prepare future bindings without exposing Rust internals.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Contributing

This project is still early. Contributions should keep the MVP philosophy intact: small, explicit, validated changes.

Suggested flow:

1. Open an issue or discussion for larger changes.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Keep PRs focused on one subsystem or vertical slice.
4. Run the full local gate before submitting.
5. Include manual validation notes when touching windowing, rendering, input, or audio.

Please avoid:

- exposing backend internals in public APIs;
- expanding FFI before the safe Rust API is stable;
- adding broad ECS/editor/hot-reload abstractions before they are required;
- mixing unrelated refactors and features in one change.
